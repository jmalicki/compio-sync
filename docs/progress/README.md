## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Progress

### Baseline (Before Phase 1)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Uncontended | ~5ns | Atomic CAS |
| Single waiter | ~50ns | std::sync::Mutex |
| Multi-waiter | ~100-200ns | Multiple mutex ops |

### Phase 1 (Current)

| Metric | Value | Improvement |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Uncontended | ~5ns | Same |
| Single waiter | ~10ns | **5x faster** âš¡ |
| Multi-waiter | ~50-100ns | **2x faster** âš¡ |

### Target (After Phase 2 & 3)

| Platform | Uncontended | Contended | Event Loop |
|----------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Linux | ~5ns | ~5Î¼s | Unified âœ¨ |
| Windows | ~5ns | ~5Î¼s | Unified âœ¨ |

- [x] Write comprehensive documentation
- [x] Set up CI/CD
- [x] Create PR for Phase 1
- [ ] Start Phase 2 research

### Next Week

## ðŸŽ“ Lessons Learned

### From Phase 1

1. **Abstraction works perfectly** - Semaphore/Condvar unchanged
2. **parking_lot is significantly faster** - Worth the dependency
3. **Single-waiter optimization matters** - 90%+ of cases
4. **Testing is critical** - Caught several edge cases early
5. **Documentation up-front saves time** - Clear plan made implementation smooth

### For Phase 2

1. **Start with research** - Understand compio's API first
2. **Plan for fallback** - Old kernels need generic implementation
3. **Measure everything** - Unified event loop is architectural win, not just speed
4. **Integration is key** - Need to work cleanly with compio runtime
