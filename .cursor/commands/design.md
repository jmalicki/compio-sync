# /design

Create a comprehensive design document based on current conversation and context.

**Important**: For new projects, create a branch first with `/branch` before running `/design`.

- feature_name (string, optional): Override the inferred feature name for the design doc filename

```bash
# Recommended workflow for new projects:
/branch "project/design-project-name" main origin true
/design "project-name"            # Creates design in new branch

# Or if just updating existing design:
/design                           # Infer everything from context
```

## Context Inference

The command automatically analyzes the current context to extract:

1. **Current conversation** 
   - What problem or idea is being discussed?
   - What solutions have been proposed?
   - What trade-offs have been considered?
   - What constraints exist?

2. **Open files**
   - What code is being reviewed or modified?
   - What's the cursor position (relevant context)?
   - What modules are involved?

3. **Recent changes**
   - Any uncommitted work (git diff)?
   - What has been modified?
   - What scope is being worked on?

4. **Feature name**
   - **If provided**: Use the specified name
   - **If not**: Derive from conversation key phrases
     - "add sparse file support" → `sparse-file-support`
     - "refactor buffer management" → `buffer-management-refactor`
     - "fix race condition in metadata" → `metadata-race-fix`

5. **Design content**
   - Extract problem statement from discussion
   - Capture proposed solutions
   - Note alternatives considered
   - Identify complexity indicators
   - List open questions

**Output**: `docs/designs/FEATURE_NAME.md`

If context is unclear, the agent will:
- Ask clarifying questions about the feature
- Request more details about the problem/solution
- Suggest discussing the design approach first

**Next Steps**:
1. Review this design with team
2. Address open questions
3. Update based on feedback
4. Create implementation plan: `/plan @docs/designs/THIS_FILE.md`
5. Execute the plan: `/implement @docs/implementation-plans/THIS_FILE.md`
```

## Output Process

When invoked, the agent should:

1. **Analyze all available context**
   - **Conversation**: What problem/idea/solution is being discussed?
   - **Open files**: What modules are relevant?
   - **Git diff**: Any work in progress?
   - **Cursor position**: Specific code being looked at?
   - **Current branch**: Get current git branch name
   - Extract key concepts, constraints, trade-offs

2. **Determine feature name**
   - **If specified explicitly**: Use provided name
   - **If not specified**: Derive from conversation
     - Look for key phrases: "add X", "fix Y", "refactor Z"
     - Extract feature name from problem statement
     - Convert to kebab-case: "Sparse File Support" → `sparse-file-support`
   - **If ambiguous**: Ask for clarification or suggest a name

3. **Extract design information**
   - **Problem**: What needs to be solved?
   - **Solution**: What approach was discussed?
   - **Alternatives**: What other approaches were considered?
   - **Constraints**: Performance, compatibility, complexity
   - **Open questions**: What's still unclear?
   - **Acceptance criteria**: What defines success?

4. **Create design document**
   - Fill in all sections based on extracted information
   - Be specific where details were discussed
   - Note uncertainties and open questions
   - Include code examples if discussed
   - Auto-determine complexity
   - Mark status as "Draft"
   - Record current branch name
   - Suggest implementation branch name

5. **Save to file**
   - Path: `docs/projects/PROJECT_NAME/design.md`
   - Create `docs/projects/PROJECT_NAME/` if needed
   - Use kebab-case for project directory name
   - Display path to user

6. **Suggest next steps**
   - **Verify branch**: If not on a feature branch, suggest creating one
   - **For new projects**: Remind to create branch first if not already done
   - Mention creating implementation plan: `/plan` (auto-finds design in project folder)
   - Suggest committing the design: `/commit "docs(project): add design"`
   - Note any open questions needing discussion
   - Suggest code review if relevant
   - Recommend who to discuss with if complex
   - Remind about implementation branch from design doc header

## Integration with /plan

Complete workflow with branching:

```bash
# 1. Create branch for new project
/branch "project/design-sparse-files" main origin true

# 2. Create the design
/design "sparse-file-support"
# Output: docs/projects/sparse-file-support/design.md

# 3. Commit the design
/commit "docs(sparse-files): add design document"

# 4. Create implementation plan (auto-finds design in project folder)
/plan
# Output: docs/projects/sparse-file-support/plan.md

# 5. Commit the plan
/commit "docs(sparse-files): add implementation plan"

# 6. Create PR for review
/pr-ready "docs: sparse file support design and plan"
```

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New project from conversation
```bash
# User: "I want to add support for sparse files to optimize disk usage"
# [Discussion about approach, trade-offs, etc.]

# Create branch first for new project
/branch "sparse-files/design" main origin true

# Agent has enough context to extract problem and solution
/design
# Infers: Project name "sparse-file-support"
# Creates: docs/projects/sparse-file-support/design.md

# Commit the design
/commit "docs(sparse-files): add design document"
```

### Scenario 2: New project with explicit name
```bash
# User: "We should refactor the buffer management to be adaptive"
# [Discussion about current issues and proposed solution]

# Create branch for new project
/branch "buffer/design-adaptive" main origin true

/design "adaptive-buffer-management"
# Creates: docs/projects/adaptive-buffer-management/design.md

/commit "docs(buffer): add adaptive buffer management design"
```

### Scenario 3: Bug fix discussion
```bash
# User: "There's a race condition in metadata handling that causes corruption"
# [Analysis of root cause and solution approach]
/design
# Infers: Project "metadata-race-fix"
# Creates: docs/projects/metadata-race-fix/design.md
```

### Scenario 4: Open files provide context
```bash
# User has src/copy.rs open
# Discussion about improving performance with zero-copy
/design
# Infers: Project from discussion and open file context
# Creates: docs/projects/zero-copy-optimization/design.md
```

### Scenario 5: Idea without implementation discussion
```bash
# User: "I have an idea to add compression support"
# Agent: "Tell me more about the use case and approach"
# [Brief discussion]
/design
# Creates: docs/projects/compression-support/design.md
# May have more open questions, less implementation detail
```

## Quality Checks

The design doc should be:

- **Complete**: All sections filled with relevant information
- **Specific**: Concrete details, not vague descriptions
- **Realistic**: Honest about complexity and trade-offs
- **Actionable**: Clear enough to implement from
- **Reviewed**: Note any areas needing more discussion

## Notes

- Design docs are living documents - they can be updated as understanding evolves
- Start with "Draft" status, move to "In Review" when ready
- Mark "Approved" after consensus, "Implemented" when done
- Include yourself in open questions if uncertain
- Link to related designs if building on previous work
- Be honest about complexity and risks
